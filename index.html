<h1><u>IMPORTANCE OF BIOMOLECULE</u></h1>
<h2><b><u> BIOMOLECULES</u></b></h2>
<br>Biomolecules are crucial for life as it helps living beings to develop, support, and replicate. 
<br>They are engaged with building organic entities from single cells to complex living creatures like people, by connecting with one another. 
<br>The variety in their shape and construction gives variety in their capabilities.
<h2><b><u>TYPES OF BIOMOLECULES</u></b></h2>
<b><li>Carbohydrates</li></b>
<b><li>Proteins</li></b>
<b><li>Nucleic acids</li></b>
<b><li>Lipids</li></b>
<h3><b><u> CARBOHYDRATE&#58;</u></b></h3>
Carbs are artificially characterized as <u>polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones</u> or mixtures which produce them on hydrolysis.
<h3><b><u> PROTIENS&#58;</u></b></h3>
Proteins are polymers of amino acids organized as polypeptide chains.Most catalysts are proteinaceous in nature.
<h3><b><u> NUCLEIC ACID&#58;</u></b></h3>
Nucleic acids allude to the hereditary material tracked down in the cell that conveys all the genetic data from guardians to offspring.
<h3><b><u> LIPIDS&#58;</u></b></h3>
Lipids are natural substances that are insoluble in water, dissolvable in natural solvents, are connected with unsaturated fats, and are used by the living cell.
